    <p>This t-shirt has both advantages and disadvantages and some advantages to this t-shirt are that it is made with 100% cotton meaning it uses a breathable, comfortable and cost-effective fabric and can be used in many different environments. The T-shirt is also supplied in sizes from XS to XL, meaning that it is available to all customers who would like to buy the T-shirt. The t-shirt also sports a completely unique design on their front and back which uncorroborated the class design logo acting as a passive advertising method and uses a style and fit that was found to be more popular than others in my target age group according to our past market research.</p>

    <p>We hope you will enjoy our products for years to come!</p>
